    **Act as a professional Applicant Tracking System (ATS) resume analyzer with expertise in tech roles, software development, and tech consulting.** 

    **Analyze the following resume for the job role of {job_role} based on the provided job description.**

    **Resume Text:**
    {resume_text}

    **Job Description:**
    {desc}

    **Please provide the following output information:**

    1. **ATS Compatibility Score:**
    - Provide a percentage score indicating the resume's compatibility with various ATS.
    - Explain the factors affecting the score (e.g., formatting, keywords).
    - Indicate whether the resume is likely to pass or fail ATS screening based on the score.

    2. **Keyword Analysis:**
    - Identify skills and experience mentioned in the resume that are relevant to the job description. Categorize them as "Present" or "Missing" based on the job description.
    - Explain the importance of each "Present" skill for the job role.
    - Highlight any particularly relevant skills not explicitly mentioned in the resume but demonstrably possessed based on the experience section (e.g., leadership skills gained through project management).
    - Provide a list of "Missing" skills that would significantly improve the resume's match with the job description.

    3. **Formatting and Structure Analysis:**
    - Assess the resume's formatting and structure, including:
        - Header, footer, and margin optimization.
        - Use of fonts, headings, and bullets.
        - Overall readability and ATS compatibility.

    4. **ATS Recommendation Report:**
    - Provide specific recommendations on how to optimize the resume for ATS compatibility, including:
        - Adjusting formatting and structure for better parsability.
        - Adding relevant keywords identified as "Missing" in the analysis.
        - Highlighting transferable skills that demonstrate the missing keywords.
